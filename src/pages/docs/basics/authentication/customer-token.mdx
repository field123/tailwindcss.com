A customer token provides access to the records of the customer. Use single sign-on or the email address and password of the customer to retrieve the [customer tokens](../../customers-and-accounts/customers/customer-tokens.md).  Use the `X-Moltin-Customer-Token` header and the implicit token to access the orders and the following APIs:

- [Get a Customer](../../customers-and-accounts/customers/get-a-customer.md)
- [Update a Customer](../../customers-and-accounts/customers/update-a-customer.md)
- [Get Customer Addresses](../../customers-and-accounts/addresses/get-all-addresses.md)
- [Get an Address](../../customers-and-accounts/addresses/get-an-address.md)
- [Create an Address](../../customers-and-accounts/addresses/create-an-address.md)
- [Update an Address](../../customers-and-accounts/addresses/update-an-address.md)
- [Get all Orders](../../carts-and-orders/orders/get-all-orders.md)
- [Get an Order](../../carts-and-orders/orders/get-an-order.md)
- [Get Customer Carts](../../carts-and-orders/carts/associations/get-customer-carts.md)
- [Create an Association between a Customer and a Cart](../../carts-and-orders/carts/associations/create-an-association.md)
- [Delete an Association Between a Customer and a Cart](../../carts-and-orders/carts/associations/delete-an-association.md)
