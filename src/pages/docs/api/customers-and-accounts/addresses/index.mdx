The Addresses API allows you to organize customer and account addresses. Addresses are a sub-resource of a [`customer`](../customers/index.md) and [`account`](../account-management/accounts/index.md) resources. A `customer` or `account` can have multiple addresses, such as `home`, `work`, and `neighbour`.

You can use a customer address with an [implicit](../../basics/authentication/implicit-token.md#post-create-an-implicit-token) Bearer token, which is recommended for client-side interactions. You can also use [client_credentials](../../basics/authentication/client-credential-token.md#post-create-a-client-credential-token) Bearer token, which is recommended for back-end interactions.

You can use an account address with either [client_credentials](../../basics/authentication/client-credential-token.md#post-create-a-client-credential-token) Bearer token or a combination of [implicit](../../basics/authentication/implicit-token.md#post-create-an-implicit-token) Bearer token and [Account Management authentication](../account-management/account-members/account-member-authentication.md) token.
