Variations allow you to create the variations that your products have. Things like size or color are examples of a Variation. Using this system you can reliably create all possible combinations of your product. [Learn more about using variations](../../../concepts/product-variations.md).

 Variations are meant to be re-usable and contain multiple products, e.g. small, medium and large. You can view your product variations on the product object under relationships.

## The Variation object

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | The unique identifier for this variation. |
| `type` | `string` | Represents the type of object being returned (should be `product-variation`). |
| `name` | `string` | A human readable name for this variation. |
| `relationships` | `object` | Relationships to other resources. |
| `relationships.options` | `object` | Relationships information regarding options for this variation. |
| `relationships.options.data` | `array` | An array of relationships from this variation to options. |
| `relationships.options.data.id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the option. |
| `relationships.options.data.type` | `string` | The type (`option`). |
| `included` | `object` | Included resources. |
| `included.options` | `array` | Array of options that constitute the variation. |
| `included.options.id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the option. |
| `included.options.type` | `string` | Represents the type of object (`option`). |
| `included.options.name` | `string` | A human readable name for the option. |
| `included.options.description` | `string` | A human readable description for the option. |
| `included.options.relationships` | `object` | Relationships to other resources. |
| `included.options.relationships.data` | `array[object]` | An array of relationships from this option to modifiers. |
| `included.options.relationships.data.id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the modifier. |
| `included.options.relationships.data.type` | `string` | The type (`modifier`). |
| `included.modifiers` | `array` | Array of modifiers that constitute the variation options. |
| `included.modifiers.id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the modifier. |
| `included.modifiers.type` | `string` | The type (`modifier`). |
| `included.modifiers.modifier_type` | `string` | One of the modifier types available. |
| `included.modifiers.value` | `mixed` | Value the modifier type allows. |
The variation object is delivered as a compound document (it includes the attached options and [modifiers](modifiers/index.md)). This is because the options and modifiers that constitute the variation are integral to its function and have no relevance in any other context.
