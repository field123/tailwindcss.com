Entries hold the pieces of data collected within the Fields.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | The unique identifier for this entry. |
| `type` | `string` | Represents the type of object being returned. |
| `fieldSlug` | `mixed` | There can be a `:fieldSlug` attribute for each field attached to the flow. The type depends on the field type. |

If your flow has more than one field related to it, you see multiple field slugs.
