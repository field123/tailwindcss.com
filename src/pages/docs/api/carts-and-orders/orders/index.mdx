## Filtering

The following operators and attributes are available for [filtering](../../basics/filtering.md) orders.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `eq` | Equals. Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are, the condition is true. |
| `like` | Like. Checks if the operand contains the specified string. Wildcards are supported. |
| `gt` | Greater than. Checks if the value of the first operand is greater than that of the second. If they are, the condition is true.|
| `ge` | Greater than or equal to. Checks if the value of the first operand is greater than or equal to that of the second. If they are, the condition is true.|
| `lt` | Less than. Checks if the value of the first operand is less than that of the second. If they are, the condition is true.|
| `le` | Less than or equal to. Checks if the value of the first operand is less than or equal to that of the second. If they are, the condition is true.|

| Attribute | Type | Operator | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `status` | `string` | `eq` | `eq(status,complete)` |
| `payment` | `string` | `eq` | `eq(payment,paid)` |
| `shipping` | `string` | `eq` | `eq(shipping,unfulfilled)` |
| `name` (`customer.name`) | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `like(name,Brad*)` |
| `email` (`customer.email`) | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `like(email,*@elasticpath.com)` |
| `customer_id` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `eq(customer_id, e5a0d684-a4af-4919-a348-f66b0b4955e0)` |
| `account_id` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `eq(account_id,3d7200c9-a9bc-4085-9822-63e80fd94a09)` |
| `account_member_id` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `eq(account_member_id,2a8a3a92-2ccd-4b2b-a7af-52d3896eaecb)` |
| `contact.name` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `eq(name,John Doe)` |
| `contact.email` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `eq(email,John Doe)` |
| `shipping_name` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `like(shipping_name,home)` |
| `shipping_postcode` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `like(shipping_postcode,117*)` |
| `billing_name` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `like(billing_name,home)` |
| `billing_postcode` | `string` | `eq` / `like` | `like(billing_postcode,117*)` |
| `with_tax` | `integer` | `gt`/`ge`/`lt`/`le` | `ge(with_tax,10000)` |
| `without_tax` | `integer` | `gt`/`ge`/`lt`/`le` | `ge(without_tax,10000)` |
| `currency` | `string` | `eq` | `eq(currency,USD)` |
| `product_id` | `string` | `eq` | `eq(product_id,6837058c-ae42-46db-b3c6-7f01e0c34b40)` |
| `product_sku` | `string` | `eq` | `eq(product_sku,deck-shoe-001)` |
| `created_at` | `date` | `eq` / `gt` / `lt` | `gt(created_at,YYYY-MM-DD)` |
| `updated_at` | `date` | `eq` / `gt` / `lt` | `lt(updated_at,YYYY-MM-DD)` |

:::note

* `with_tax` and `without_tax` should be integers without currency decimals, so a value of `10000` would be equivalent to `$100.00`.
* `product_id` and `product_sku` match orders where matching product has been ordered (but they cannot have been the only ordered items).
* `eq` shouldn’t be used with dates; instead, use a range (`gt` & `lt`) if you want orders for a specific day. Filtering on exact timestamps is not supported.

## Payments

After an order is created, it is marked unpaid. See [Paying for an order](../../payments/paying-for-an-order/index.md) for how you can mark this order as paid.
