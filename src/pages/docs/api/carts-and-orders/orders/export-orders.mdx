Use the `jobs` endpoint to export orders to a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. For the available filter types, see [filtering](index.md#filtering).

After a job is created, it returns a `pending` `status`. After a job is `complete`, you can access the file using the provided endpoint. For more information about the `jobs` endpoint, see [Jobs](../../advanced/jobs/index.md).
