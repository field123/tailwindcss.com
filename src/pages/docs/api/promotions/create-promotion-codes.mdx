 | `codes` | Required | `array` | Specifies the code details in an array of objects. |
 | `codes[].code` | Required | `string` | Specifies the string to use as a code for the promotion. |
 | `codes[].uses` | Optional | `integer` | Specifies the number of times the code can be used. If no value is set, the customer can use the code any number of times.|
 |`codes[].user` | Optional | `string` | Specifies a string that specifies the users who can use the code. You can use the customer object ID or an array of customer object IDs. For more information, see the [Create a customer](../customers-and-accounts/customers/create-a-customer.md) section. Additionally, you could pass any identifying string to the promotions service that identifies a user.|
 | `consume_unit` | Optional | `string` | Specifies whether the code is applied to a line item or cart. The options are `per_item` or `per_cart`. The default setting is `per_cart`, which is applied at cart level. The `per_item` setting specifies how many times a buyer can use a promotion code on promotion items in a cart. For example, in a store that offers 50% off on SKU1, but limits the maximum usage of the promotion code to two, buyer can apply the promotion to SKU1 up to 2 times if cart has two quantities of SKU1. The third SKU1 is sold for regular price. The code usage is applied at checkout. You must set the `automatic` setting to `false` and create a code for this promotion to work.|
