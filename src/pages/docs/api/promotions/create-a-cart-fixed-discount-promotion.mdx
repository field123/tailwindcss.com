## `POST` Create a cart fixed discount promotion

```http

```

## Parameters

### Headers

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | Required | `string` | The Bearer token required to get access to the API. |

### Body

 | Name | Required | Type | Description |
 | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | `type` | Required | `string` | Specifies the type of the resource. The type of resource for promotions is, `promotion`.|
 | `name` | Required | `string` | Specifies a name for the promotion. |
 | `description` | Required | `string` | Specifies a description for the promotion. |
 | `enabled` | Required | `boolean` | Specifies whether the promotion is enabled. The options are `true` or `false`, and the default setting is `false`. |
 | `automatic` | Required  | `boolean` | Specifies whether the promotion is applied automatically to the cart or a code is required to apply the promotion. The default setting is to `false`. When this value is set to `true`, a code is autogenerated. If this value is set to `false`, you must create the code manually. For more information about creating codes, see the [Create Promotion Codes](create-promotion-codes.md) section.|
 |`promotion_type`|Required  |`string`| Specifies the type of the promotion. Use `fixed_discount` for fixed value cart promotions.|
 |`min_cart_value`| Optional  |`array`| Specifies an array of currency-value objects, `min_cart_value[].currency` and `min_cart_value[].amount`, that provides the minimum cart value required for the promotion to apply. You can add one or several value specifications in different currencies. **Note** Do not use `max_discount_value` for this promotion. If you set a maximum discount value for the cart, the `max_discount_value` overrides the `fixed_discount` value and the promotion does not work. |
 |`schema`|Required |`object`| Specifies the promotion value, currency, and the products to be excluded from the promotion, if any. The currency values are provided in a `currencies` array with the values `currencies[].currency` and `currencies[].amount`. The `productID`s or `SKU`s of products to be excluded from the promotion are provided in the `exclude` array.|
 |`start`| Required  |`string`| Specifies the start date and time of the promotion or the start date of the promotion. You can provide a specific time in the HH:MM format. For example, `"start": "2000-01-01 12:00"`. If no time is specified, the default start and end time is set to `00:00`.|
 |`end`| Required  |`string`| Specifies the end date and time of the promotion or the end date of the promotion.|
