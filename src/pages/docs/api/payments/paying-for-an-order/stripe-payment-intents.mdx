## `POST` Confirm the security validation succeeded

```http
https://api.moltin.com/v2/orders/:orderId/transactions/:transactionId/confirm
```

If the response for the authorization or purchase request consists of `client_parameters`, Stripe might required client action to perform a 3D Secure validation. Use the Stripe client libraries and process the 3D Secure validation. When the validation succeeds, continue the payment processing by making a request as in the following example:
