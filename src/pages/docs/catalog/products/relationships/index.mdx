:::tip Choose the right endpoint
If you are using the [Product Content Management](../../../../concepts/product-content-management.md) services, use the `pcm/products` endpoints instead of the `v2/products` endpoints. For details about the `pcm/products` endpoints, see the topics in the [PCM Products](../../../pcm/products/index.md) section.
:::

Relationships associate products with other resources, such as files and hierarchies. In addition, relationships link parent products to their child products.
